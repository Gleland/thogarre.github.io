This inspiration came from when I was in grad school, trying to finish my error analysis assignments. Basically, how can you trust the computer (or programming language) to conserve whatever significant figure you have during a calculation?
Included in this repository are sigfigs.py, which has the code to count the number of significant figures in a number, and test.py, which will allow the user to run a test to confirm whether the code works in its method.</description></item></channel></rss>
