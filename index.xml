This inspiration came from when I was in grad school, trying to finish my error analysis assignments. Basically, how can you trust the computer (or programming language) to conserve whatver significant figure you have during a calculation?
Included in this repository are sigfigs.py, which has the code to count the number of significant figures in a number, and test.py, which will allow the user to run a test to confirm whether the code works in its method.</description></item><item><title/><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>
Welcome! This is my personal website, it’s meant to show some of the more interesting projects that I’ve worked on and to give me an excuse to learn some more programming along the way. It’s constantly changing, so I apologize if something looks a little off.
