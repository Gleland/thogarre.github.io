# Welcome!

This is my personal website, it’s meant to show some of the more interesting projects that I’ve worked on and to give me an excuse to learn some more programming along the way. It’s constantly changing, so I apologize if something looks a little off.

Currently I’m a Systems Development Engineer at AWS. I’m living in the Greater Boulder area with my partner, Kathryn. We enjoy traveling, reading, and eating good food.
